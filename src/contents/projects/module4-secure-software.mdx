> ## Short Explanation

This module of the programme covers Secure Software Development at the University of Essex Online. The module is six units, lasting six weeks and include the key aspects and skillsets of a career in cybersecurity.

Additionally, introduces look at the security risks which are associated with programming languages, from the perspectives of design and architecture approaches, programming paradigms, testing, the impact and implications of operating systems and libraries on software development, the security risks associated with distributed systems and APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design.

> ## Module Goals

Our team was tasked to develop an application providing a secure repository for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. Each domain had a different set of conditions, including a specialised set of tools and equipment to meet the requirements mentioned earlier. As Group two, we worked on developing a secure repository for the ISS (International Space Station), including considering application requirements such as arising from GDPR, minimising potential attack exposure areas and following monolithic design principles as much as possible.

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 6-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Identify relevant academic literature which discusses the ways in which secure software may be developed using an agile process.
- Decompose an activity into a set of tasks which can be represented using a flow chart from the UML portfolio of modelling techniques.
- Describe the importance of creating a culture of risk awareness in an organisation, in addition to the creation of secure software.
- Research the academic literature (e.g., published by IEEE, ACM, Elsevier or ScienceDirect) on software development which follows an agile process and prioritises security.
- Become familiar with the language and concepts of a security standard which has been published by the ISO/IEC.
- Describe some key milestones in the development of programming languages.
- Outline some of the key paradigms that define the different types of languages.
- Explain the key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.
- Discuss key programming challenges and recommended best practices.
- Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including the following outcomes:

- Describe the key terms which are associated with testing software for security.
- Prepare a list of questions to ask when designing a test plan for secure software.
- Design software tests through understanding the range of ways which the security of software can be breached.
- Design an ontology which can be used in standardised service deployments.
- Give examples of fog computing, IoT and Cyber Physical System components and solutions.
- Describe some of the security issues with the above-mentioned systems.
- Recommend emerging technologies and solutions to investigate.
- Recommend which programming language is the optimum to adopt to support a secure system.
- Provide evidence to support your recommendation.
- Make recommendations on the way(s) in which programming languages might be extended to meet the security needs of our modern world.
