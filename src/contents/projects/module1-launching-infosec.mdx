> ## Short Explanation

This first module of the programme covers an introduction to the MSc. Cybersecurity program at the University of Essex Online. The module is twelve units, lasting twelve weeks and include the key aspects and skillsets of a career in cybersecurity. The University also introduce the core topics and knowledge base required to support the remainder of the modules in the programme, which will examine those subjects in greater detail.

As I proceed through the units, I will make numerous entries in this portfolio to document my advancement and share insights accumulated from the assigned reading, interaction with other students and completed exercises. In addition to unit summaries, there may be individual postings covering module essays or any other interesting topics. The links below lead to these summaries and unit overviews.

> ## Module Goals

The module consist of one essay and Python-based project requiring a clinic patient booking system.

Completing end module project, including python code to address one of the security challenges noted in the technical report of unit 9 is required.
The code outline and python code with results can be viewed separately via the link provided under the Project section

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 12-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) in Cybersecurity.
- Develop an awareness of the implications of security breaches.
- Critically evaluate the implications of vulnerabilities and threats in software and networks.
- Appreciate the competencies required to be able to address Cyber Security issues.
- Evaluate available techniques and technologies at database and metadata levels dealing with privacy and data disclosure.
- Develop knowledge about approaches to identify vulnerabilities and threats.
- Gain awareness of the ethical and governance frameworks around information systems security and data protection acts.
- Apply knowledge to mitigate the identified issues.
- Develop an awareness of emerging trends in Cyber Security.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

As predicted, the module study is well-known to me. I can describe and explain definitions of different terms such as Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability easily. Also, I possess solid experience in conducting risk assessments, vulnerability scans and selecting appropriate controls based on risk tolerance and client priorities. However, the diversity of viewpoints and experiences of other students provides the opportunity for growth. Much of the focus in these first three units is around collaborative learning discussions. Unlike traditional undergraduate courses, which rely on exams, this type of learning requires more critical thinking and a willingness to take risks in arguing a position or thesis. These interactions of collaborative learning discussions are an exciting exchange and provide invaluable insight and expanded methods of critical examination. This experience extends well beyond the 3 or 4 required peer interactions.

#### Personal Take-Away

Based on the collaborative learning discussions and the taken lecture casts during these units, I developed the following outcome: Geographic origin, the home system of Government and cultural differences affect the value and expectation of personal privacy rights. And the level of privacy willing to be exchanged for a feeling of security does not always match the baseline privacy expectation. Thus, for example, while the implementation of GDPR implies a substantial value on privacy for Europe, it also causes the most severe surveillance-related concerns. For one who plans to operate in companies with an international presence, this is important and should be noted for further study.

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including the following outcomes:

- Develop solutions that will efficiently identify vulnerabilities and threats in software and over networks.
- Develop security requirement documents to ensure security is embedded in a software development process.
- Develop the capacity to predict security issues in software and develop appropriate solutions to deal with them.
- Develop the ability to apply concepts and principles of secure object-oriented analysis and design.
- Develop the knowledge and skills required for programming.
- Develop the ability to implement a security designed solution.
- Develop the ability to identify the software components and associated threats.
- Employ the UML modelling techniques to identify software dataflow, storage, and security issues.
- Apply the knowledge and skills to other security issues in software development.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

Dealing with secure object-oriented analysis and design has been a new territory. I have learned the basics of designing secure databases and how to perform pre-coding modelling of use cases and abuse cases using Universal Modeling Language (UML). Unit 6 wrapped up with an 'outline' for a technical report on the security issues, risks and potential controls involved in developing a secure web-based appointment scheduling system for a large medical centre. Due in unit 9, the report will include UML diagrams for both use and abuse cases and recommend controls for each. This scenario will be the final part for the end of course project due in unit 12, which includes a detailed description of one of the issues identified in this essay and applies a custom control via original python code.

#### Personal Take-Away

The collaborative discussions and critical analysis of other students were valuable in expanding viewpoints and critical analysis.

### Unit 7-9

This unit summary covers units between 7-9, including the following outcomes:

- Develop the conceptual framework for database design.
- Apply the principles to implement a database management system.
- Understand database security issues.
- Implement basic Python scripts.
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot syntax and semantic errors in code.
- Develop the ability to implement a database using MySQL database management package.
- Develop the capacity to write Python script to accept input and store data in MySQL database.
- Implement security measures to data.
- Identify errors in security solution implementation code.
- Understand validated security requirements.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

These units helped to understand better the database designing from a secure by default perspective. Significantly contributed to the pending module project by addressing the potential issues and impacts of security during each section of the database designing. Realised how any of the dull functions can have a noticeable effect on related data. Moreover, these units also supported pros/cons analyses of functionalities vs security implications. Lastly, helped in developing tools and methods to find errors in syntax or algorithms in python code.

#### Personal Take-Away

The collaborative discussions and critical analysis of other students were valuable in expanding viewpoints and critical analysis.

### Unit 10-12

This unit summary covers units between 10-12, including the following outcomes:

- Understand the concepts and principles of web applications development.
- Appraise the techniques and frameworks for secure web application development.
- Develop an awareness and understanding of the industry standards and guidelines for securing web applications.
- Implement the MVC architecture for web application.
- Implement security libraries for user access controls, verification, and authentications.
- Apply the concepts and principles of web applications development.
- Develop the ability to evaluate frameworks for secure web application development.
- Apply industry standards and guidelines to secure web applications.
- Develop an awareness of emerging trend and future developments in Cyber Security.
- Engage with research activities in the various areas of Cyber Security.
- Understand the implications of future developments on privacy and data confidentiality.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

Viewed lecturecast: A look into the future of Cyber Security. Explored current, ongoing research activities and future forecasting of emerging technologies for improved cybersecurity and privacy.

The end module project is completed, including python code to address one of the security challenges noted in the technical report of unit 9. The code outline and python code with results can be viewed separately via the link provided under the Project section.

#### Personal Take-Away

The end module project helped accumulate coding knowledge, which is considered crucial in analysing software and database structure during security reviews.
