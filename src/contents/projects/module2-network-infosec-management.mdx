> ## Short Explanation

Our team required to exercise and explore different set of tools widely used in Cybersecurity field that mainly use for penetration testing activities.

> ## Module Goals

Our team was tasked to prepare a design proposal document, including assigning one of the business functions such as industry recruitment, e-health or e-commerce site to a made-up organisation called Pink e-health services’ website. Afterwards, conducting a vulnerability scanning to produce a professional-grade executive report, including identified vulnerabilities, potential threats, suggested improvement measures to address risks, and further considerations based on GDPR and PCIDSS requirements was the next and final part of the assignment.

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 12-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Explain the basic principles of Information Security Management.
- Describe the 4 tenets/ principles of Information Security Management.
- Describe what constitutes a threat and vulnerability.
- List several common roles within the Information Security profession.
- Describe a number of typical vulnerabilities of modern electronic devices.
- Explain how common vulnerabilities can be exploited using software toolkits.
- Use industry standard toolkits to classify and evaluate threats and vulnerabilities.
- Describe the fundamental concepts of networks.
- Evaluate a number of widely available tools to use for basic network troubleshooting.
- Explain the differences between the IPv4 and IPv6 standards.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

As predicted, the module study is well-known to me. Describing fundamental concepts and definitions such as Networks, Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), or relation between threats and vulnerabilities were effortless to understand. Yet, it was particularly interesting using standard toolkits to classify and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities. In addition to that, the diversity of viewpoints and experiences of other students provided the opportunity for growth. Collaborative learning discussions were a noticeable focus area of the first three units. These discussions were more challenging than traditional courses that rely on exams and promote critical thinking simultaneously. However, these interactions of collaborative learning discussions were an exciting exchange and provided invaluable insight and expanded methods of critical examination.

#### Personal Take-Away

Collaborative learning discussions, seminars and lecture casts were constructive, especially in further developing threat modelling and risk scoring techniques such as STRIDE and DREAD. Furthermore, working on real-world issues and potential implications of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities concerning medical devices and the healthcare industry significantly contributed to a better understanding of different viewpoints.
Additionally, these unit discussions were particularly focused on healthcare IT systems’ threats and vulnerabilities, including potential mitigation techniques. And I tried to summarise my study in the following summary post:

> **_Security and Privacy of Healthcare IoT Devices_**

_In the initial post, we analysed potential vulnerabilities and threats mentioned in the “Compromising a Medical Mannequin” (Glisson et al., 2015) paper. Then, the researchers used various techniques to break the medical mannequin under a controlled environment, and I listed the following potential mitigations or countermeasures to overcome these threats:_

_There could be alternative ways of executing brute force attacks, such as in rapid coordinated (distributed brute-force attacks) or slow-paced manner. In order to counter these attacks, a wide variety of countermeasures, such as employing solid passwords, avoiding the use of default usernames or changing them something different, disabling SSH-based logins for administrative IDs (e.g., root account, or encouraging sudo), or running SSH on a non-standard port and the use of TCP wrappers to block IP addresses that used for repeated login attempts could be utilised. In addition, honeypots, IDSs (Intrusion Detection System) and NACs (Network Access Control) would be considered as other countermeasures, especially for DoS attacks and malicious intents such as eavesdropping of the internal network. For example, IDS could support avoiding taxation of hardware resources and help in mitigating brute force attacks too._

_In summary, we observed that there are many ways to exploit or compromise M-IoT assets, including medical mannequins. However, there are also proven and effective countermeasures as mentioned above to mitigate these potential threats._

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including following outcomes:

- Perform basic troubleshooting and investigations using the tools provided as part of common operating systems (tools such as ping, traceroute and so on).
- Analyse the outputs provided by the tools.
- Discuss the difference between TCP/IP and the ISO/OSI protocol stacks.
- Describe the different network tools and components available.
- Explain when and where to use selected tools and components.
- Evaluate the security implications of using selected components.
- Identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities in IT network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by information security professionals.
- Select a toolset to use for scanning and vulnerability testing.
- Justify your selection.
- Submit the first part of your course assessment.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

These units were more challenging and provided an opportunity to learn more about network fundamentals, a thorough review of various network components such as routers, firewalls, vulnerability scanning tools, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. Exploring network components have been an entirely new area and helped me to strengthen my network-focused understanding. Unit six was particularly interesting since it covered the initial stages of the team project. In addition to that, the diversity of viewpoints and experiences of other students provided the opportunity for growth. Collaborative learning discussions were a noticeable focus area across all units. These discussions were more challenging than traditional courses that rely on exams and promote critical thinking simultaneously. However, these interactions of collaborative learning discussions were an exciting exchange and provided invaluable insight and expanded methods of critical examination.

#### Personal Take-Away

The first part of the project was about setting the scene to perform vulnerability scanning, including detection and testing. There were also several pre-requisites, such as appropriately selecting applicable standards (PCI-DSS) and regulations (GDPR) after assigning business functions to the so-called website of the organisation. Debating on potential vulnerability scanning tools, interactions on the collaborative discussion forums regarding the outcome of these scanning and internal group discussions were particularly exciting. Moreover, it also solidified the required skills for purple team exercises.

### Unit 7-9

This unit summary covers units between 7-9, and the stated unit outcomes are:

- Describe the purpose of risk assessment.
- Explain how to mitigate risks.
- Describe the difference between business continuity and disaster recovery.
- List common security standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.
- Explain which GDPR regulations are applicable to the project assignment.
- Describe which other standards the project assignment needs to meet.
- Advise on mitigations to help a website meet any of the standards applicable to its specific industry, such as data and privacy (GDPR) or financial (PCIDSS).
- Explain how and why logging is used in security systems.
- Describe which tools to use for logging and analysis.
- Explain how logging is used in incident investigations.
- Describe the best forensic techniques to use.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

Risks and Standards were particular focus areas of these units. Advancing further in assigned tasks and performing scanning exercises provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with various active and passive information-gathering tools. Furthermore, identifying applicable GDPR requirements based on the scanning output and discussing potential mitigations further expanded understanding of how grifted relation exists between data security and privacy, particularly in the legislative area. In addition to that, the diversity of viewpoints and experiences of other students provided the opportunity for growth.

#### Personal Take-Away

Security Incident investigation techniques such as logging and forensics of Unit nine has been entirely new to me, especially forensics. Digital forensics is a must to develop new capabilities, especially to counter adversaries and avoid potential data breaches. Thus, the forensic techniques studied in Unit nine provided solid background and helped in gaining practical experiences.

### Unit 10-12

This unit summary covers units between 10-12, and the stated unit outcomes are:

- Utilise the breach checklist to analyse a breach.
- Recommend a number of actions and tools based on the analysis.
- Critically assess published responses.
- Describe emerging trends and technologies.
- Explain the impact of emerging changes.
- Describe some challenges encountered with both current and new solutions.
- Describe several potential future Internet architectures.
- Argue for and against several architectures.
- Reflect on the role of Information Security Management in modern computing solutions.
- Identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities in IT network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including Internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by information security professionals.

#### Progressive Learning Experience

Producing an executive summary report was a particular focus area of these units. The executive summary report was the final part of the project assignment. Our team focused on the imaginative e-health themed website of pink e-health services organisation’ target assets, assessment approach, methodologies, tools, standards, and threat risk analysis methodologies to produce the final report. Employing various active and passive information gathering techniques, debating the rationale of identified vulnerabilities, incorporating a STRIDE-based threat classification scheme, and performing DREAD-based risk assessment/scoring provided invaluable hands-on experience. Moreover, performing several scans and utilising different scanning tools supported a distilled view on vulnerabilities, including the elimination of false positives.

#### Personal Take-Away

Personally involved in creation of risk rating matrix, incorporation of DREAD-based risk assessment/scoring method and documentation of limitations around various approaches. These were noticeable contributions in producing an executive summary and well received within the team. Working in a team promoted creativity. Additionally, it has maximised the shared knowledge within the team. There could have stale viewpoints if we were working as individuals; thus, the teamwork helped us avoid that potential concern.
