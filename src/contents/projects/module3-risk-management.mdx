> ## Short Explanation

This module of the programme covers Information Risk Management at the University of Essex Online. The module is six units, lasting six weeks and include the key aspects and skillsets of a career in cybersecurity.

Additionally, introduces to the underpinning concepts and principles of Information Risk Management (IRM). This includes a review of traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, focusing on the areas most affected by risk management considerations.

> ## Module Goals

Our team was tasked to conduct a risk assessment and create a detailed risk assessment report, including appropriate disaster recovery solutions based on the needs and prerequisites of the organisation. Afterwards, producing a professional-grade risk assessment report, incorporating analyses of potential business and technology-related risks, recommending tailored risk assessment methodologies and listing appropriate disaster recovery solutions linked to the preferred ERP implementation option was the second and final part of the assignment.

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 6-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Discuss the various definitions of risk.
- Explain how to assess, qualify and mitigate risks.
- Describe various approaches to quantify and qualify risks.
- List common risk standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.
- Discuss the differences between assessment approaches (Qualitative vs. Quantitative).
- Explain the importance of user participation in the risk management process.
- Discuss the implications of any recommended mitigations.
- Describe what the SDLC is – and the different implementation methodologies available.
- Explain how risks affect the SDLC.
- Describe how to mitigate risks in a selected SDLC methodology.

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including the following outcomes:

- Explain the differences between common studies of risk and the SDLC.
- Describe the most common risks encountered at each phase of the SDLC.
- Propose some mitigations for the most common risks.
- Explain what is meant by BC, DR, RTO and RPO.
- Suggest the most suitable solutions to meet specific recovery objectives.
- Discuss some of the factors driving the future of the Information Risk Management field.
- Describe the major trends driving the future of IRM.
- Enumerate the NSA hard problems, and argue which are affected by IRM.
- Contribute to the argument supporting your preferred influencing factor.
