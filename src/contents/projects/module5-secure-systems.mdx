> ## Short Explanation

This programme module covers Secure System Architecture at the University of Essex Online and lasts six weeks. As I progress through the units, I document all the achievements, invaluable insights, screenshots of contributions and unit summaries below

> ## Module Goals

Our team was tasked to work on modelling potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with smart home devices based on Attack Trees. Additionally, the team is required to develop a python-based system to demonstrate interactions between smart sensors, devices and controllers. It also included addressing common challenges of distributed systems such as power consumption, latency, security and lost messages concerns.

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 6-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Understand the ways in which distributed systems have evolved to support evolutions in applications and user activities.
- Explain how Operating Systems work and the purpose of processes, threads and schedulers.
- Describe how to set up and use OS Containers (e.g., Docker).
- Discuss the steps involved in evolving a monolith system to a microservice system.
- Create a flow chart using UML or SysML notation within an open-source modelling tool.
- Implement the sockets which support distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.
- Understand the core objectives of implementing secure mechanisms to support communications in distributed systems, including confidentiality, integrity and availability.

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including the following outcomes:

- Create a producer-consumer implementation using Python.
- Research the literature to identify the Quality of Service requirements of distributed applications.
- Appreciate the challenges of running secure operating and distributed systems in the modern world.
- Research the state-of-the-art literature to examine current approaches used to support distributed networking.
- Research the use of system modelling tools.
- Engage in a debate on the options available for assessing the security profile of distributed systems.
- Investigate the academic literature to build a case arguing for the best method of assessing distributed systems security.
